A tool for computing conditional expected rewards for stochastic games with reachability and total rewards objectives. It has itÂ´s own data type for an stochastic game. It also has an input generator, for an example called "Roborta vs. the fair Light". 

To run the tool: 


    $ python3 conditionalrewards.py -f inputs/FILENAME

To run the input generator:

    $ python3 roberta_generator.py
